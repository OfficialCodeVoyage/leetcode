# leetcode

This repository contains my practice solutions for LeetCode problems. Each solution is implemented in Python and organized by problem number, following the same order as LeetCode.

## Description

This repository is dedicated to my personal practice and contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. It serves as a learning resource for me and for anyone who is interested in understanding different ways to solve coding problems.

## Installation

To run the solutions, ensure you have the latest version of Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

Each problem is stored in its own directory within the `leetcode` directory. You can navigate to the specific problem's directory and run the solution using Python. For example:

```bash
cd leetcode/1.TwoSum
python solution.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an alternative solution or an improvement to an existing solution, feel free to contribute. Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-new-solution).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new solution for problem X').
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature-new-solution).
5. Open a pull request.

## Structure

The solutions are organized numerically by problem number and name, corresponding to their problem number on LeetCode. For example:

```
leetcode/
├── 1.TwoSum/
│   └── solution.py
├── 2.AddTwoNumbers/
│   └── solution.py
```
